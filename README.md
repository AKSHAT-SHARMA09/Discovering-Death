# Discovering-Death
This is a data science project based on the aviation accident dataset posted on kaggle. Our goal was to create a model that can predict if a flight accident will be fatal or not based on relevant variables. It is a classification problem where Machine Learning techniques like Decision Trees, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine(SVM) were used as Univariate models and MultiVariate models like TensorFlow Neural Network , Logistic Regression , SVM, Random Forest and Naive Bayes being used.  Additionally, a Time Series Regression Model was also added to predict which time of the year proves to be the most fatal for Flight accidents.
